# Managing mail

## Selecting more than one message at a time

Tap the contact icon on the left of the message to select one or more messages.

![Multi select](img/managing_multiselect.png)

When one or more messages are selected, actions appear in the Action Bar at the top. There is also
an overflow menu, so some of the actions might require you to tap the right hand menu icon (three dots).
If you are unsure of the meaning of an icon, you can safely long-press it to show a tooltip.

![Message Options](img/reading_actionbar_options.png)

The icons have the following meanings:

<table>
<tr>
<td> <img src="../img/ic_trash_can.svg" class="example_icon"> </td><td>Delete </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <img src="../img/ic_opened_envelope.svg" class="example_icon"> </td><td>Mark as read</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <img src="../img/ic_mark_new.svg" class="example_icon"> </td><td>Mark as unread</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <img src="../img/ic_archive.svg" class="example_icon"> </td><td>Move the selected message(s) to the configured Archive folder</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Swipe actions

Actions on a message can also be triggered by swiping it to the left or to the right. Dragging the list item in either direction
reveals the icon and the name of the action. The message has to be dragged a certain distance before the action will be performed when
the list item is released (finger is lifted from the screen). The background color changes from a gray to a colored background when that
threshold is crossed. To not perform the action, keep your finger on the screen and drag the item back towards its original position until
the background changes to gray again, then release the item.  
The swipe gesture doesn't have to be performed slowy. Flinging the message to the left or to the right will work as well.

Which action is performed can be configured separately per swipe direction under
*General Settings → Interaction → [Swipe actions](../settings/general.md#swipe-actions)*.
