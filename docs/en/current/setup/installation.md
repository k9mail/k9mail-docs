## Installation

Once you have obtained the APK file from [one of the app stores](https://k9mail.app/download) it will be installed 
automatically. Depending on the version of Android you have you may be prompted to accept K-9's use of permissions.

## Permissions

See [app permissions](permissions.md) for a list of permissions the app requests along with an explanation of why that
is necessary.
