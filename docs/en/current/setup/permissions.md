# Permissions

In order to perform various tasks and provide a cohesive email client, K-9 uses various permissions. See our 
[Privacy Policy](https://k9mail.app/privacy) for information on how we handle personal information obtained via these 
permissions.

For Android 6 and above, only the Contacts permission will be requested by a system dialog when you use the app.
The rest are granted automatically when you install K-9.

### Network Communication

#### Full Internet Access

In order to connect to your email server, K-9 needs the ability to create and manage network connections. We do this 
with careful consideration for both battery life and security - only opening connections as needed.

### Read your contacts

In order to mark e-mail that comes from your contacts and use your contacts to provide email address auto-completion, we
need access to your contacts.
