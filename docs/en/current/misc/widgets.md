# Widgets

As well as application icons, Android allows users to add widgets to their launcher screens.

K-9 has a small number of built-in widgets to show information in the launcher.

## K-9 Accounts Widget

The accounts widget allows you to have an icon that links directly to an inbox - either a single inbox, all messages or 
the unified inbox.

The icon for this is the K-9 mascot, the same as the application icon.

## K-9 Unread Email Widget

The unread email widget is connected to the unread messages for a single inbox, all messages or unified inbox.

The icon for this is an envelope.
