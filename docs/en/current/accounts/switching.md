# Switching between multiple accounts

The default view is the Unified Inbox.
This shows you a combined list of the emails in all your accounts' inboxes.

Using the “manage folders” button in the side bar, you can include/exclude specific folders (including the inbox of an account) from the unified inbox.

To switch to a specific account, tap the drawer icon in the top left corner.
